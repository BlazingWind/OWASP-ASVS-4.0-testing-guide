# Getting started with ZAP scripts
Check out the PDF guide for getting started with using ZAP scripts.

If you prefer a video instruction on how to set up ZAP and use ZAP scripts, see the video [here](https://vimeo.com/702190939) for the [ZAP ASVS checks repo](https://github.com/YaleUniversity/ZAP_ASVS_Checks). The ZAP ASVS Checks repo has been merged with this one and the process shown in the video should be almost the same, with the exception of the repo name.
