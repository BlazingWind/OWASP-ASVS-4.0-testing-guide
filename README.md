# OWASP ASVS 4.0 testing guide

## Introduction

The OWASP ASVS 4.0 testing guide is an unofficial supporting document to the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) which attempts to describe each level 1 control, what are the consequences of not being compliant with it, how to test it - with known open source tools or manually - and the criteria for the control to be valid. Additionally, to several controls there have been developed scripts using bash or [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) scripting engine to automate the check of said controls. The "ZAP-scripts" folder includes a guide on how to get started with ZAP scripts.

The aim of this project is to assist companies and organizations with getting started with using OWASP ASVS.
